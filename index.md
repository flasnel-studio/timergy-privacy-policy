# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: July 13, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use Timergy ("the App").

## Information Collection

Timergy is designed to function entirely on your device. We collect and store the following information locally on your device:

- Tasks you create
- Focus session data
- App settings and preferences

Timergy does not automatically collect any data from your device. All data is stored locally on your device using secure local storage.

## App Permissions

Timergy requests the following permissions:

- **Notification Permission** (`POST_NOTIFICATIONS` for Android 13+): Used to display timer completion notifications when your focus and break sessions end. Notifications are sent locally on your device only when a focus session (focus or break) completes. We do not use this permission for any other purpose. Before requesting this permission, we provide a clear explanation of why it's needed (Prominent Disclosure). You can disable notifications at any time through the app settings or your device settings.

- **Internet Permission** (`INTERNET`): Required to load the online version of this privacy policy when you choose to view it through the app. No user data (tasks, sessions, settings) is transmitted online. This permission allows the app to access web content only for displaying legal documents.

- **Vibrate Permission** (`VIBRATE`): Used to provide haptic feedback when notifications are displayed and for UI interactions (button presses). This enhances the user experience but does not access or transmit any data.

## Permissions Explicitly Removed

For transparency, the following permissions are explicitly removed from the app to ensure data privacy:
- `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` - Not needed as app functions offline
- `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` - App doesn't access external files
- `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` - App doesn't write to external storage
- `WAKE_LOCK` - App doesn't need to keep device awake
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` - App doesn't run background services

## Use of Information

The information stored locally on your device is used solely for the following purposes:

- To provide the core functionality of the app (task management and time tracking)
- To display your productivity statistics
- To maintain your app preferences

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

Timergy does not share any of your data with third parties. All data remains on your device and is not transmitted to external servers.

## Data Security

We implement appropriate technical measures to protect your data stored locally on your device. However, please be aware that no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your data. You can delete tasks, clear session history, or uninstall the app to remove all data.

## Children's Privacy

Our App does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take necessary actions.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

## Data Deletion

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you can delete your data by:

- Clearing app data through your device settings
- Using the in-app option to clear all data (if available)
- Uninstalling the application
